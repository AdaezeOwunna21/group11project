In order to run the website, first open the terminal and navigate to the backend folder:


```bash
cd ~/Documents/group11project/backend/
```

and then type: node app.js

```bash
cd ~/Documents/group11project/backend$ node app.js
```

You should see: Backend server running on port 4000


Then open another terminal besides the first one, and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/group11project/frontend/
```

and then type: npm run dev

```bash
cd ~/Documents/group11project/frontend$ npm run dev
```

App.js should automatically show the homepage 


**Note:**  The frontend fetches backend dynamically using the .env variable.
